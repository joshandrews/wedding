                    <hr class="primary">
                    <div class="rose-img sr-icons"></div>
                    <p>Josh and Emily met 5 years ago in their first year at UBC.  Emily was from Prince Rupert BC and Josh had most recently lived in London, England.  Josh always said that before they met he saw Emily through the cafeteria window and it was "love at first sight". They started dating about 3 months after meeting each other. Josh took Emily to the rose garden at UBC on November 26th where they sat in the cold and Josh told Emily how much she meant to him and asked if they could start dating.</p>
                    <div class="mountain-img sr-icons"></div>
                    <p>Roughly four and a half years later on June 25, 2016, Josh took Emily to his favourite place in the world. A cabin that his family went to every summer on Kalamalka Lake in Vernon BC. They have been going there every summer since they started dating and have laid on the dock under the stars dreaming about their future together. As many of their friends like to say Josh kind of pulled a "Chandler Bing" on Emily by convincing her a few nights before that a proposal was not happening anytime soon (even though he secretly already had the ring). Emily was very surprised when Josh led her down the cabin stairs to the dock which was lit up with 48 candles. He says he had a speech prepared but as soon as they got out on the dock his emotions were so strong he couldn't say it so he just got down on one knee and asked Emily to be his wife. He told her through tears about how they were going to one day bring their kids to this very spot on the dock at the cabin and tell them their story. It was a very emotional, joyful, and beautiful time.</p>
                    <div class="ring-img sr-icons"></div>
                    <p>Josh and Emily enjoy many different "typical" Vancouver activities from running the BMO half marathon (Emily beat him ðŸ˜œ), to hiking, skiing, snowshoeing, and just generally being in the outdoors. When they are at the cabin in Vernon they enjoy water skiing, kayaking and paddle boarding as some of their favourite activities. They also both LOVE coffee and are admittedly both kind of coffee snobs :P. They both enjoy deep theological conversations, and listening to and playing music together. They are also very excited to get married...</p>
